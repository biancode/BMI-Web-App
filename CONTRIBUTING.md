## Rules

### Naming Rules

- Use underscores for seperating words in filenames example and lowercasing only `line_graph.js` or `dashboard.js`

### Directory structure


- Put all CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) into the `src/<component>/css` Folder the naming should be `css/<component>/feature_name.css` 
- Put all Javascript files into the `src/<component>/js` Folder the naming should be `js/<component>/feature_name.js`
- All HTML Files are put directly into the `src/<component>/` Folder named as `src/<component>/feature_name.html`

`<component>` is the name of your component you are working on.
